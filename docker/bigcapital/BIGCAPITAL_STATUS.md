# BigCapital MongoDB Connection Issue - Status Report

## üîç Current Status: KNOWN ISSUE

### Problem Summary
BigCapital is experiencing MongoDB connection errors when built from source. The error "MongoParseError: Invalid connection string" persists despite multiple configuration attempts.

### ‚úÖ What We've Confirmed Working
- ‚úÖ MongoDB container is running and accepting connections
- ‚úÖ MariaDB and Redis containers are healthy
- ‚úÖ Docker networking is properly configured
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are correctly set in docker-compose.yml

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
- ‚ùå BigCapital cannot connect to MongoDB
- ‚ùå Environment variables are not being properly used by the built application
- ‚ùå BigCapital appears to have hardcoded MongoDB connection strings

### üß™ Solutions Attempted
1. **MongoDB Authentication**: Tried with and without authentication
2. **Connection String Formats**: Tested multiple MongoDB URI formats
3. **Environment Variables**: Added multiple variations (MONGODB_URI, MONGO_URL, DATABASE_URL)
4. **Build Arguments**: Added build-time arguments to docker-compose
5. **Container Restart**: Restarted containers with new configurations
6. **Pre-built Image**: Attempted to use pre-built image (not available)

### üîß Current Workarounds

#### Option 1: Use BigCapital Cloud (Recommended)
Instead of self-hosting, use BigCapital's cloud service:
- Sign up at https://bigcapital.ly
- Configure the middleware to connect to cloud BigCapital
- Update `config/plugins.json` with your BigCapital cloud credentials

#### Option 2: Alternative Accounting Systems
The middleware supports other accounting platforms:
- Invoice Ninja (open source)
- InvoicePlane (simpler setup)
- Custom API integrations

#### Option 3: Development with Mock Data
For testing the middleware:
- Use the middleware without BigCapital integration
- Test with Paperless-NGX document processing
- Add accounting integration later

### üöÄ Next Steps for BigCapital Self-Hosting

The BigCapital self-hosting setup requires further investigation:

1. **Build Process Analysis**: Need to examine BigCapital's build configuration
2. **Configuration Override**: Find the correct way to override MongoDB settings
3. **Alternative Branches**: Try building from different Git branches/tags
4. **Community Support**: Reach out to BigCapital community for self-hosting guidance

### üìä Current Middleware Status

**‚úÖ WORKING:**
- Paperless-NGX integration
- Document processing and OCR
- Web interface and API
- Plugin architecture
- System diagnostics

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK:**
- BigCapital self-hosted integration
- Full document-to-accounting workflow

### üéØ Recommendations

For **immediate use**:
1. Deploy the middleware with Paperless-NGX
2. Use BigCapital cloud for accounting needs
3. Connect via API when ready

For **development/testing**:
1. Focus on document processing features
2. Use mock data for accounting integration tests
3. Implement other accounting system plugins

For **production deployment**:
1. Consider BigCapital cloud service
2. Evaluate alternative self-hosted accounting systems
3. Wait for BigCapital self-hosting improvements
