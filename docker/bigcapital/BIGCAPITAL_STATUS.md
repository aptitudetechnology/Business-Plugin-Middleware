# BigCapital MongoDB Connection Issue - Status Report

## üîç Current Status: KNOWN ISSUE

### Problem Summary
BigCapital is experiencing MongoDB connection errors when built from source. The error "MongoParseError: Invalid connection string" persists despite multiple configuration attempts.

### ‚úÖ What We've Confirmed Working
- ‚úÖ MongoDB container is running and accepting connections
- ‚úÖ MariaDB and Redis containers are healthy
- ‚úÖ Docker networking is properly configured
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are correctly set in docker-compose.yml

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
- ‚ùå BigCapital cannot connect to MongoDB
- ‚ùå Environment variables are not being properly used by the built application
- ‚ùå BigCapital appears to have hardcoded MongoDB connection strings

### üß™ Solutions Attempted
1. **MongoDB Authentication**: Tried with and without authentication
2. **Connection String Formats**: Tested multiple MongoDB URI formats
3. **Environment Variables**: Added multiple variations (MONGODB_URI, MONGO_URL, DATABASE_URL)
4. **Build Arguments**: Added build-time arguments to docker-compose
5. **Container Restart**: Restarted containers with new configurations
6. **Pre-built Image**: Attempted to use pre-built image (not available)

### üîß Current Solutions

#### Option 1: Continue BigCapital Self-Hosting Investigation
The issue is solvable - we need to:
- Examine BigCapital's source code for configuration patterns
- Create a custom Dockerfile with proper environment variable handling
- Try building from different Git branches or tags
- Override configuration files during the build process

#### Option 2: Alternative Self-Hosted Accounting Systems
The middleware supports other open-source accounting platforms:
- **Invoice Ninja** (fully featured, Docker-ready)
- **InvoicePlane** (lightweight, easier setup)
- **Akaunting** (modern interface, good API)
- **Crater** (simple invoicing system)

#### Option 3: Temporary MongoDB Override
For development/testing:
- Continue with the current setup for document processing
- Mock the accounting integration temporarily
- Focus on perfecting the Paperless-NGX ‚Üí BigCapital data flow

### üöÄ Next Steps for BigCapital Self-Hosting

The BigCapital self-hosting setup requires further investigation:

1. **Build Process Analysis**: Need to examine BigCapital's build configuration
2. **Configuration Override**: Find the correct way to override MongoDB settings
3. **Alternative Branches**: Try building from different Git branches/tags
4. **Community Support**: Reach out to BigCapital community for self-hosting guidance

### üìä Current Middleware Status

**‚úÖ WORKING:**
- Paperless-NGX integration
- Document processing and OCR
- Web interface and API
- Plugin architecture
- System diagnostics

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK:**
- BigCapital self-hosted integration
- Full document-to-accounting workflow

### üéØ Recommendations

For **immediate development**:
1. Deploy the middleware with Paperless-NGX
2. Set up Invoice Ninja as an alternative accounting system
3. Perfect the document processing pipeline

For **BigCapital self-hosting**:
1. Create custom Dockerfile with configuration overrides
2. Examine BigCapital's configuration system
3. Try alternative BigCapital deployment methods
4. Build from specific commits/branches that work

For **production deployment**:
1. Get BigCapital self-hosting working properly
2. Implement comprehensive testing with real invoices
3. Add monitoring and backup procedures
